# phpbruteforce is a simple and fast enough php hash bruteforce.
## Usage
You can use [hash type]brute.php?[hash type]=[your hash]&passlen=[password length]&alphlen=[alphabet length]<br>
[hash type] - your md5 or sha1 hash<br>
Password length - max password length. On my weak and 10 years old laptop it finds "test" within 3 seconds.<br>
Alphabet length - max is 36 (0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz). You can't use loweralpha without numbers, number 9 without all previous numbers etc.<br>
